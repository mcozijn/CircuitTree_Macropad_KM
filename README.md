# Unofficial CircuitTree Macropad QMK + Vial firmware

This repository houses the QMK and VIAL keyboard and keymap files for the CircuitTree Macropad, aswell as a pre-built firmware for easy remapping.

_NOTE: currently, the OLED has no functionality, but this will be added soon_:tm:

_NOTE 2: Even though it should natively support macOS, I have not tried since I don't have a USB-C to Micro-USB cable to test_
